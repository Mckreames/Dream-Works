                  Constants: This project was assigned during my time at
                  Tennessee Tech with the objective to use the "Bisection
                  Method" of root finding to calculate the pH of rainwater for
                  each year listed using the CO2 readings via the National
                  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data collected in
                  Honolulu Hawaii. Using the given equations for the chemical
                  make-up of rainwater and the provided constants, I constructed
                  a formula that would allow MATLAB to calculate the approximate
                  pH for a specific year. With this formula I can apply the
                  bisection method to approximate the pH and show the percent
                  error after a set 35 iterations. Since we can let MATLAB do
                  the heavy lifting for calculations, we see that the
                  approximate pH of the rainwater is moving down in pH heading
                  to be more acidic in nature. The results I found from my
                  program shows the year, the concentration of CO2 from the NOAA
                  website and the calculated pH. Years Concentration of CO2 pH
